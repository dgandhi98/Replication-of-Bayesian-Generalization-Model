# Replication-of-Bayesian-Generalization-Model

## Introduction
A replication of a paper by Tenenbaum.
This project applies a Bayesian generative model to simulate cognitive generalization from particular instances. It takes in a few particular instances of numbers, then generates a probability distribution by testing possible interval hypotheses. It was a really interesting project in applying data science & statistics to model cognitive processes from a top-down processing standpoint.



## Dependencies
