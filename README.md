# Replication-of-Bayesian-Generalization-Model

## Introduction
A replication of a model from 
Tenenbaum & Griffiths (2001). Generalization, similarity, and Bayesian inference. _Behavioral and Brain Sciences_, 24, 629-640.

This project applies a Bayesian generative model to simulate cognitive generalization from particular instances. It takes in a few particular instances of numbers, then generates a probability distribution by testing possible interval hypotheses. It was a really interesting project in applying data science & statistics to model cognitive processes from a top-down processing standpoint.
